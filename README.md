Software Engineer
-----------------

As a software engineer with four years of experience, my journey in web development has been deeply rooted in the Ruby ecosystem, particularly with Ruby and Ruby on Rails.

What excites me most about Ruby is its metaprogramming capabilities, which allow me to create code that is not only functional but also elegantly expressive. This experience has sharpened my technical skills and given me a deep understanding of software design principles.

I strongly believe in Test-Driven Development (TDD). For me, well-tested code isn't just about preventing bugs; it's the foundation of building reliable and stable software. This approach has been integral to my practice, ensuring that the applications I develop meet the highest standards of quality.

Additionally, I have a keen interest in Domain-Driven Design (DDD), which aligns closely with developing software that reflects real-world business scenarios. This philosophy has guided me in designing scalable and maintainable systems, which I see as essential for any business-driven technology, especially in dynamic fields like blockchain and web3.

While my primary experience has been with Ruby, my fascination with the evolving landscape of blockchain technology has led me to explore Solidity and web3. I am excited about the prospect of contributing to diverse interactions across wallets, dApps, and blockchains.
